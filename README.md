# IITB Suburban Railways Simulator
This repository aims to consolidate the contributions of various subgroups
working on the Mumbai Suburban Railways Project, 2025. The goal is to develop a data-driven methodology for Mumbai Railways to decide the order in which to
replace non-AC rakes with AC rakes.

## Independent Tasks
There are three subgroups working on independent tasks. Each task has its own directory on branch `main`.

### a. Dashboard (Armaan)
Graphical interface. This directory will implement all the functionality
contained in b,c,d.

### b. Rake Cycle Visualization

### c. Entropy Calculation

### d. Timetable Generation
